# AGC Token Staking dApp

This project is a proof-of-concept (POC) for an AGC Token Staking decentralized application (dApp) built with React and TypeScript.

## Warning

This dApp is part of an ongoing audit by Tephracore. DO NOT interact with this application if you are not part of the audit process. Unauthorized interaction may result in loss of funds. This POC is for demonstration purposes only.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.x or later)
* You have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
* You have a Windows/Linux/Mac machine.

2. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Notes
This project is a POC for a staking dApp for AGC token, where users can stake their AGC tokens, and the project was built for
demonstration purposes only. The project was built to show how locking/unlocking of tokens are vulnerable and how it can be exploited. A full audit report of the vulnerability can be found [here](https://github.com/lordx64/web3_audit/blob/main/reports/agc_audit.pdf)

This project is built with React and TypeScript, and uses ethers.js for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
